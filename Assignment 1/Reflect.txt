1. No i cant think of a more efficent way of asking the user to add the required information for each data field
because in the case of using a struct you can make a template that you can reuse in different scenerios but just
changing the information that is entered without having to repeatedly enter the same data fields everytime you want
to add a new, in this case "contact".
2.A C string thats is required to hold 25 must be able to hold 26 characters because if there are blank spaces that
are present in the string or if we decide to use the same struct for another variable and there character limit is more
or less then there doesnt need to be any changes to the string limit.
