3. The fucntion findcontactindex makes it easy to determine the slots of the array
and how many people are in the array so that if there was a contact removed you would
be able to add a person in, or if there was a slot open you would be able to add another 
contact into the array, the getTenDigitPhone would be used to identify each contact 
by their phone numbers and whenever you needed to find a contact or make changes to one 
you could enter the phone number of that contact to identify the contact you wanted to 
make changes to.

need my code to do and then call the functions in my code approprialy when i need them 
to save from redundant coding and from make extra complicated code that doesnt need to be like that.
