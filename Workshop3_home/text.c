The iteration contructs are while, do while and for.

The while loop carries out the sequece when the conditions for the loop are true whereas
the do while loop carries out the sequence of the loop one time before checking if its true and 
continuing to run the loop as long as the condition is true.

Conditional expression are kinda of like flowcharts that have a senario and different paths that 
can be taken based off of "conditions" that must be met for the path to do down either one side or the other
this is used in programming to carry out loops.
