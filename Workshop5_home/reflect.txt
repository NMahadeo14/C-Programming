1.The advantages of using an array of structs vs parallel array is that only one rray index
calculation is needed and having all the related data together makes it work better with the 
cpu memory, also when using an array of structs it gives the advantage of only having to add in 
one array not multiple so it is easier to implement into your code.
2.This is because when we use a header file the code in the header file is duplicated inside each c file
in which it was included, which allows us to write code, like a struct, in one spot and edit it in that one spot
alone.
