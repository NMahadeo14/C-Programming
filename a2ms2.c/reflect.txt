1.The Term Fucntion means a relationship or expression involving one or more variables that work
or operate in a proper or particular way, functions are used in programming to prevent 
redundent coding, so for example where ever you have a line of code that you are gonna keep using 
over and over, you can make a function that does that and call the function whenever u need 
to write that line of code which is shorter and more conveinent.
2. the helper functions were in a different module because they werent really impacting the contact file
they were their own fucntions that are gonna display and sort information that the contact file is 
taking in, and they are only being used in the contact.c file to be called on to stop repetitive coding
not to change the c file completely.
